This is the clever macro to use for a mimic panel.

It was initially described here:

I have modified it to allow compiling for either two pin route indicators or single pin route indicators.

For two pin route indicators use:

#define TWO_PIN_MIMIC

for single pin route indicators use:

#define ONE_PIN_MIMIC

The circuit for the single pin route indicators is in the pdf file.
